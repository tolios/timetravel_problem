# timetravel_problem

This repo is used for storing a project for the course Programming Tools and Technologies for Data Science for the master's Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML) of the National and Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

The main idea is that, supposing someone timetraveled in the past with a list of stocks of companies, what strategy would he employ to make as much profit as possible, starting with a portofolio of 1 US Dollar!!! With some technical restrictions (for the security of spacetime continuum).
